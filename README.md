## 📈 Excel + Python Analysis (Lesson 1)

### Excel Deliverables
- Built **pivot tables & charts** to analyze sales and profit by region, category, and segment.  
- Created **business-friendly visuals** for direct consumption.  

### Python Deliverables
- Used `pandas` and `matplotlib` to **replicate Excel insights programmatically**.  
- Generated reproducible charts and reports.  

📊 **Sample Visuals (Lesson 1):**  
![Sales by Region](sales_by_region.png)  
*The West dominates sales & profit compared to other regions.*  

![Profit by Category](profit_by_category.png)  
*Technology is the most profitable category, while Furniture struggles with low margins.*

## 🗄 SQL + Python Analysis (Lesson 2)

In Lesson 2, I extended the analysis into **MySQL + Python integration** to show how real analysts query and visualize data directly from a relational database.  

### ❓ Business Questions Answered
1. Which region drives the most sales & profit?  
2. Which categories and sub-categories are most profitable?  
3. Who are the top 10 customers by lifetime sales?  
4. Which regions have the highest profit margins?  
5. What are the top 10 most profitable products?  
6. How do sales & profit trend over time (monthly)?
